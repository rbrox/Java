# Java Collections Framework Overview :rocket:

The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces in Java that provide powerful, high-level data structures and algorithms to manipulate collections of objects. It simplifies the handling and storage of groups of objects, making it easier for developers to manage data effectively. In this readme.md file, we will provide a brief explanation of each subtopic related to the Collections Framework, along with example coding problems.

## :pushpin: Collection Interfaces

### :bookmark_tabs: `List<E>` Interface (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList) :memo:
The List interface represents an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate elements. Implementations of List include ArrayList and LinkedList, among others.

**Sample Problem:** Write a function that takes a List of integers and returns a new List containing only the unique elements in the original List. :pencil2:

### :bookmark_tabs: `Set<E>` Interface (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet) :scroll:
The Set interface represents a collection of unique elements, which means no duplicates are allowed. Implementations of Set include HashSet and TreeSet, among others.

**Sample Problem:** Given two sets of integers, write a function to find their union, intersection, and difference. :pencil2:

### :bookmark_tabs: `Map<K, V>` Interface :world_map:
The Map interface represents a key-value pair mapping, where each key is associated with a value. Implementations of Map include HashMap and TreeMap, among others.

**Sample Problem:** Create a program to count the occurrences of each word in a given text and store the results in a Map. :pencil2:

## :pushpin: Collection Classes

### :orange_book: `ArrayList<E>` :bookmark_tabs:
An implementation of the List interface that uses a dynamic array to store elements. It automatically resizes when elements are added or removed.

**Sample Problem:** Write a function that takes an ArrayList of integers and returns the sum of all the elements in the list. :pencil2:

### :orange_book: `LinkedList<E>` :chains:
An implementation of the List interface that uses a doubly-linked list to store elements. It provides efficient insertion and deletion operations.

**Sample Problem:** Implement a stack data structure using a LinkedList to support push, pop, and peek operations. :pencil2:

### :orange_book: `HashSet<E>` :sparkles:
An implementation of the Set interface that uses a hash table to store unique elements. It offers constant-time performance for basic operations.

**Sample Problem:** Given an array of integers, find all the pairs of elements whose sum equals a given target value. :pencil2:

### :orange_book: `TreeSet<E>` :deciduous_tree:
An implementation of the Set interface that uses a Red-Black tree to store unique elements in sorted order. It maintains elements in ascending order.

**Sample Problem:** Write a function to find the kth smallest element in a TreeSet. :pencil2:

## :pushpin: Accessing a Collection via an Iterator

### :scroll: Using an Iterator :point_right:
An example of how to use an Iterator to iterate through elements of a collection.

**Sample Problem:** Write a function that takes a List of strings and prints each element in reverse order using an Iterator. :pencil2:

## :pushpin: The for-each Alternative

### :loop: The Enhanced For Loop (for-each) :arrows_counterclockwise:
The enhanced for loop provides a simpler way to iterate through collections, arrays, and other Iterable objects.

**Sample Problem:** Given an array of integers, find the sum of all the even numbers using the for-each loop. :pencil2:

## :pushpin: Map Interfaces and Classes

### :bookmark_tabs: `HashMap<K, V>` :world_map:
An implementation of the Map interface that uses a hash table to store key-value pairs. It offers fast retrieval and insertion but does not maintain order.

**Sample Problem:** Create a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the occurrences of each character using a HashMap. :pencil2:

### :bookmark_tabs: `TreeMap<K, V>` :deciduous_tree:
An implementation of the Map interface that uses a Red-Black tree to store key-value pairs in sorted order based on the natural ordering of the keys or a custom comparator.

**Sample Problem:** Write a function that takes a TreeMap of strings as input and returns a new TreeMap containing only the elements that start with a vowel. :pencil2:

## :pushpin: Comparators

### :balance_scale: Comparator Interface :straight_ruler:
The Comparator interface allows custom sorting of objects in collections based on specific criteria.

**Sample Problem:** Implement a comparator to sort a list of Person objects based on their age in ascending order. :pencil2:

## :pushpin: Collection Algorithms

### :gear: Collections Class :wrench:
The Collections class provides several utility algorithms for working with collections, such as sorting, searching, and shuffling elements.

**Sample Problem:** Given an ArrayList of strings, write a function to sort the strings in alphabetical order. :pencil2:

## :pushpin: Arrays

### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Arrays Class :1234:
The Arrays class provides various utility methods for working with arrays, including sorting and searching.

**Sample Problem:** Write a function to find the second largest element in an integer array. :pencil2:

## :pushpin: Legacy Classes

### :bookmark_tabs: `Stack<E>` :card_file_box:
A legacy class that represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack data structure.

**Sample Problem:** Use a Stack to check if a given expression with parentheses is balanced. :pencil2:

### :bookmark_tabs: `Vector<E>` :file_folder:
A legacy class similar to ArrayList but with synchronized methods, making it thread-safe.

**Sample Problem:** Write a multithreaded program that uses Vector to store and process data concurrently. :pencil2:

### :bookmark_tabs: `HashTable<K, V>` :file_cabinet:
A legacy class similar to HashMap but with synchronized methods, making it thread-safe.

**Sample Problem:** Create a program that reads a file and counts the occurrences of each word using a HashTable. :pencil2:

### :bookmark_tabs: `Dictionary<K, V>` :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
A legacy abstract class representing a key-value storage.

**Sample Problem:** Implement a custom Dictionary class that allows case-insensitive key lookup. :pencil2:

### :bookmark_tabs: `Properties` :gear:
A subclass of Hashtable that represents a persistent set of properties, typically used for configuration settings.

**Sample Problem:** Build a program to read a properties file and display its contents. :pencil2:

## :pushpin: More Utility Classes

### :scissors: `StringTokenizer` :scissors:
A class to break a string into tokens based on a delimiter.

**Sample Problem:** Write a function that takes a string containing comma-separated values and converts it into an array of integers using StringTokenizer. :pencil2:

### :game_die: `Random` :game_die:
A class to generate random numbers.

**Sample Problem:** Create a program that simulates rolling two dice and calculates the probability of getting a sum of 7. :pencil2:
